# Lexis
Symbolic Entity State Tracking

The first version of Lexis was described in [this article](https://aclanthology.org/2021.law-1.13/). This is an expansion of Lexis based on the error analysis performed in the paper.

For the complete experiments and the description of the approach, refer to Chapter 4 of my dissertation (link to be provided later in 2023).
